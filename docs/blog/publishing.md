# Publishing Insights (Astro)

Articles live in **`src/content/insights/`**, organized by audience or service hub—not a flat `/blog` folder.

## Content folders

| Path | URL pattern |
|------|-------------|
| `insights/startup-founders/*.md` | `/insights/startup-founders/{slug}/` |
| `insights/enterprise-engineering/*.md` | `/insights/enterprise-engineering/{slug}/` |
| `insights/operations-leaders/*.md` | `/insights/operations-leaders/{slug}/` |
| `insights/small-business/*.md` | `/insights/small-business/{slug}/` |
| `insights/services/product-engineering/*.md` | `/insights/services/product-engineering/{slug}/` |
| `insights/services/applied-ai/*.md` | `/insights/services/applied-ai/{slug}/` |
| `insights/services/workflow-automation/*.md` | `/insights/services/workflow-automation/{slug}/` |
| `insights/services/cloud-architecture/*.md` | `/insights/services/cloud-architecture/{slug}/` |

Hub index pages: `/blog/`, `/blog/{tag}/`. Legacy `/insights/*` URLs redirect via `astro.config.mjs`.

## Hero image (required before publish)

Generated **after** the article is written—not during research.

| Step | Detail |
|------|--------|
| When | After `blog-writer` saves the markdown |
| Agent | `blog-image` (see [hero-image.md](./hero-image.md)) |
| Asset | `src/assets/blog/{slug}.webp` (or `.jpg` / `.png`) |
| Frontmatter | See depth table in [hero-image.md](./hero-image.md) |

Placeholders (`blog-placeholder-*.jpg`) are for local dev until the hero step completes.

## Frontmatter template

```yaml
---
title: 'Post Title'
description: '150–160 character meta description.'
pubDate: '2026-06-02'
heroImage: '../../../assets/blog/your-post-slug.webp'
personas: ['Startup Founders']
services: ['Product Engineering']
technologies: ['React & Next.js', 'JavaScript & TypeScript']
industries: ['Startups & SaaS']
---
```

For files under `insights/services/...`, use **four** levels: `heroImage: '../../../../assets/blog/your-post-slug.webp'`.

Replace `your-post-slug` with the markdown filename (without extension). The `blog-image` agent sets this automatically after generation.
